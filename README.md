## 🧾 Overview

This project is a responsive and modern **Checkout Page UI** built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5. It features a billing form, shopping cart, promo code input, and payment section – all optimized for both desktop and mobile users.

This UI was designed as a part of my internship task to demonstrate front-end development skills, visual consistency, and responsiveness.
