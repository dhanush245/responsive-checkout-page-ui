## 📘 About This Project

This project was developed as part of my internship at **KnackForge Pvt Ltd** and is focused on crafting a **visually appealing, user-friendly checkout page** for a fictional e-commerce platform. The primary objective was to demonstrate my front-end development skills using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap 5**, while emphasizing clean UI practices and responsiveness.

The page includes two main sections:

### 1. 🧾 Billing & Payment Form
This form is designed to collect user details needed for processing an online order. It includes:
- First name and last name inputs
- Username with @ prefix input
- Email field with optional hint
- Address line 1 and line 2
- Dropdowns for Country and State
- ZIP/Postal code
- Checkboxes for address preferences
- Payment method options: Credit Card, Debit Card, PayPal
- Fields for cardholder name, card number, expiry, and CVV

Every input is crafted using Bootstrap’s form components and classes, ensuring accessibility and responsive alignment.

### 2. 🛒 Shopping Cart Sidebar
This sidebar remains sticky (on larger screens) and shows:
- A list of cart items with name, price, and brief descriptions
- A highlighted promo code entry
- Total price calculation
- A promo code input box with a “Redeem” button

The cart helps simulate the user experience just before completing an e-commerce transaction. While no backend functionality is implemented in this version, the layout is designed for easy integration with form handling scripts or APIs.
